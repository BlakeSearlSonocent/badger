# ðŸ¦¡ Badger
A GitHub action to add customised badges to pull requests.

## Usage
To install and start using this action, create a new `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml` file in your repository. You can copy the example YAML configuration below as a template. Once the template is copied into your workflow file, you can add or remove badges as you please. Badges are specified in the following format;

> `label: message (option=value)(option=value)`

The badge options are optional and can be excluded if you are happy with the defaults.

Badger does not support any output variables.

### Example Workflow
Below is an example workflow which runs badger when PRs are opened. It adds two badges linking to environments based on the branch name, it also optionally adds a third badge. The third badge uses custom variables which must be provided in the PR description. If the variables are not provided in the description then the badge will not be generated.

```yml
on: 
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  pr-description:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Update PR Description
    steps:
    - name: Add Badges
      id: badger
      uses: StevenMilneDev/badger@v1.0.0
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        badge-01: 'Website: {{branchname}}.gleanweb.sonocent.com (link=https://{{branchname}}.gleanweb.sonocent.com)(icon=google_chrome)'
        badge-02: 'Strapi: strapi.{{branchname}}.gleanweb.sonocent.com (link=https://strapi.{{branchname}}.gleanweb.sonocent.com)(icon=strapi)'
        badge-03: 'Trello: {{trello.card}} (link={{trello.url}})(icon=trello)'
```
